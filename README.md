# Movie Recommender System

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a **content-based movie recommender system** using **Count Vectorizer**, **Stemming**, and **Cosine Similarity**. The recommender system suggests movies based on the content of movies a user has previously interacted with. The project utilizes the **TMDB dataset** and applies **NLP techniques** to enhance the recommendation accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies by analyzing movie features such as genres, descriptions, and cast.
  
- **NLP Techniques**: Applied **Stemming** and **Count Vectorizer** to convert movie descriptions into numerical form for similarity calculations.

- **Cosine Similarity**: Used to compute the similarity between the vectorized movie features, which helps identify movies with similar content.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For Count Vectorizer, similarity computation, and evaluation metrics.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For stemming and other NLP tasks.
- **TMDB Dataset**: Used to build the recommender system.
